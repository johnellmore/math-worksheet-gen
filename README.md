# Math worksheet generator framework

This is a basic math worksheet generator framework that I threw together to let me generate a sheet of simple math problems that are age-appropriate for my kids.

It's built to support all types of equations, but I've only implemented basic addition and substraction right now. I likely won't develop this much further.

## Running

Run an HTTP server locally in the project directory:

```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

And visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
